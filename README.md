# SQL- ASSIGNMENTS
# 1.DDL COMMANDS
I will create a School database and a STUDENT table with columns Roll_No, Name, Marks, and Grade. Your tasks include adding a Contact column, removing the Grade column, and renaming the table to CLASSTEN. I Will display the data, delete all rows, and finally drop the table from the database. This project demonstrates proficiency in using DDL commands for database management.
CREATE,ALTER,DROP,TRUNCATE,RENAME 

# 2.DDL CONSTRAINTS
I worked on creating and managing a database named Sales with a table called Orders, applying constraints like Primary Key, Unique, and Not Null. I added a new column, renamed the table to sales_orders, and inserted 10 rows of data. After retrieving specific data and updating a product name, I deleted the sales_orders table. This project demonstrated my SQL skills in database creation, manipulation, and management.
Primary Key,Unique,Not Null

# 3.DML COMMANDS
In this task, I will create and manage a database table named Managers using SQL. The table will store information about managers, such as their ID, name, date of birth, age, gender, department, and salary. I will enforce constraints like NOT NULL and CHECK to ensure data validity. Once the table is created, I will insert 10 records into it. After that, I will write SQL queries to retrieve specific information, such as fetching a manager's details based on their ID, calculating their annual income, filtering out specific records, and displaying managers based on salary and department conditions. This exercise will help me to practice essential SQL operations, including table creation, data insertion, and query writing for data retrieval and filtering.
