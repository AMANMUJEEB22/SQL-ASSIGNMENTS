# SQL- ASSIGNMENTS
# 1.DDL COMMANDS
I will create a School database and a STUDENT table with columns Roll_No, Name, Marks, and Grade. Your tasks include adding a Contact column, removing the Grade column, and renaming the table to CLASSTEN. I Will display the data, delete all rows, and finally drop the table from the database. This project demonstrates proficiency in using DDL commands for database management.
CREATE,ALTER,DROP,TRUNCATE,RENAME 

# 2.DDL CONSTRAINTS
I worked on creating and managing a database named Sales with a table called Orders, applying constraints like Primary Key, Unique, and Not Null. I added a new column, renamed the table to sales_orders, and inserted 10 rows of data. After retrieving specific data and updating a product name, I deleted the sales_orders table. This project demonstrated my SQL skills in database creation, manipulation, and management.
Primary Key,Unique,Not Null

# 3.DML COMMANDS
In this task, I will create and manage a database table named Managers using SQL. The table will store information about managers, such as their ID, name, date of birth, age, gender, department, and salary. I will enforce constraints like NOT NULL and CHECK to ensure data validity. Once the table is created, I will insert 10 records into it. After that, I will write SQL queries to retrieve specific information, such as fetching a manager's details based on their ID, calculating their annual income, filtering out specific records, and displaying managers based on salary and department conditions. This exercise will help me to practice essential SQL operations, including table creation, data insertion, and query writing for data retrieval and filtering.

# 4.QUERYING DATA
In This task I work with relational databases to create and manage tables, including Country and Persons. I insert sample data into these tables to simulate real-world scenarios. Using SQL, I perform various queries to analyze and retrieve data, such as listing distinct country names, filtering persons by rating or country, and extracting population details based on conditions. I also practice advanced querying techniques like using aliases, NULL checks, and range conditions. This project helps me  strengthen our database management and SQL querying skills for real-world applications.

# 5.SORTING AND GROUPING DATA
In this project, I focus on sorting and grouping data using SQL. I create two tables, Country and Persons, and populate them with sample data. SQL queries are used to perform various tasks, such as extracting substrings, concatenating fields, counting unique values, and calculating maximum and minimum populations. I also insert rows with NULL values to practice handling missing data and write queries to count and analyze such instances. Additionally, I explore data aggregation, such as grouping by country, calculating total populations, and determining average ratings, along with sorting results to extract meaningful insights. This project helps me to master data manipulation and analysis using SQL.
# 6.JOINS AND UNION
To work with the Country and Persons tables, first set them up with appropriate fields and relationships. The Country table holds information about countries, and the Persons table stores details about individuals, linked to countries via a foreign key. Once the data is added, you can perform tasks like joining the tables (inner join for matching rows, left join to include all from Persons, and right join to include all from Country). You can also fetch distinct country names from both tables using a UNION, or include duplicates with UNION ALL. Finally, you can round the ratings in the Persons table to the nearest integer using the ROUND() function. These queries allow you to efficiently extract and analyze the data.
